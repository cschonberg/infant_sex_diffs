investigation 6377 mother-infant dyads participated in a teaching task as part of the sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). Analyses focused in deciphering the role of maternal sensitivity and verbal stimulation as contributors to the infant’s social-emotional (S-E) and cognitive (Cog) development.

Results: For the infant’s S-E development, our hypothesis that maternal sensitivity would be a stronger predictor than verbal stimulation was not supported; nor did we find support for our hypothesis that the association would be moderated by age. For Cog development, only verbal stimulation had a direct positive effect on the infant’s cognitive ability; our findings for moderation showed that mothers spoke more to older infants than younger infants.

Linear regression analyses revealed sex differences in the associations between empathic distress and concern on the one hand and physical aggression at age 20 months on the other. Furthermore, physical aggression at age 30 months was predicted by the interaction of sex with empathic distress at age 20 months, while controlling for aggression at age 20 months. More empathic distress and concern were associated with less physical aggression in girls, but not in boys.

However few studies have focused on the specific characteristics of ID singing that change across the first months of life. We aimed to explore these changes between 3 and 6 months because musical routines become prominent in the repertoire of games parents and infants spontaneously play during a period referred to as ‘the period of games’. We focused specifically on expressive timing because it reflects how mothers dynamically adapt their singing to their infant's states of attention and involvement.

To determine the effect of developmental care on neurodevelopmental outcome in formerly preterm infants at a corrected age of 2 years.
Methods
A prospective phase-lag study was performed at an Austrian neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). From January 2003 to December 2005 (study period of conventional care) and January 2007 to December 2009 (study period of developmental care), we enrolled all infants born in Tyrol at less than 32 weeks of gestation. During this period a total of 261 of 359 preterm infants (participation rate 72.7%) completed the follow-up visit at 2 years of age; there were 124 children in the conventional and 137 in the developmental care group. The association between developmental care and delayed motor or mental development (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II; psychomotor or mental developmental index <85) was analyzed by means of logistic regression analysis at a corrected age of 24 months.
Results
Children in the developmental care group showed less psychomotor delay than did those in the control group (developmental care group: 16.1%, conventional care group 27.4%; adjusted odds ratio 0.37 [95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.74], P = 0.005).

Literature addressing the effects of television exposure on developmental skills of young children less than 36 months of age is scarce. This study explored how much time young children spend viewing television and investigated its effects on cognitive, language, and motor developmental skills.
Methods
Data were collected from the Pediatric Clinics at University Medical Center in Southern Taiwan. The participants comprised 75 children who were frequently exposed to television and 75 children who were not or infrequently exposed to television between 15 and 35 months old. The age and sex were matched in the two groups. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development-second edition and Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition were used to identify developmental skills. Independent t-tests, _2 tests, and logistic regression models were conducted.
Results
Among 75 children who were frequently exposed to television, young children watched a daily average of 67.4 min of television before age 2, which was excessive according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Viewing television increased the risk of delayed cognitive, language, and motor development in children who were frequently exposed to television. Cognitive, language, and motor delays in young children were significantly associated with how much time they spent viewing television. The type of care providers was critical in determining the television-viewing time of children.
Conclusion
We recommend that pediatric practitioners explain the impacts of television exposure to parents and caregivers to ensure cognitive, language, and motor development in young children. Advocacy efforts must address the fact that allowing young children to spend excessive time viewing television can be developmentally detrimental.","cognition/cognitive development, language, motor delay, television exposure",1,No,108 boys; 42 girls,24.8,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

In this study, we investigated associations between early competencies and problems, as measured by the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), and the timing of achievement of the main gross and fine motor milestones usually attained during the first year of life in a general population context. The study sample consisted of 515 infants (mean age 12.9 [SD 0.9] months) and their parents (514 mothers, 434 fathers), who were recruited in child health centers in Northern Finland. The infants were divided into two groups, based on their BITSEA screen status, and motor milestone achievement ages were compared across BITSEA screen status No Concern and Of-Concern infants. An Of-Concern screen status on the maternal and paternal Competence scale and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) item cluster was associated with later infant achievement ages for gross motor milestones. By contrast, infants who were screened to be in the Of-Concern range on the maternal Problem scale achieved gross motor milestones earlier than infants with the corresponding No Concern screen status. No significant associations were found between the paternal Problem scale screen status and infant motor development. In further analyses, the strongest associations were found between an Of-Concern screen status on the paternal Competence scale and ASD item cluster and infant motor development. The findings indicate that the inclusion of infant motor developmental information may assist early identification and the clinical interpretation of parental reports of early SEB problems.

Three hypothetical paths were postulated to explore how play and language drive each other: (1) direct paths, whereby initiation of basic forms in symbolic action or babbling, will be directly related to all later emerging language and motor outputs; (2) an indirect interactive path, whereby basic forms in symbolic action will be associated with more complex forms in symbolic play, as well as with babbling, and babbling mediates the relationship between symbolic play and speech; and (3) a dual path, whereby basic forms in symbolic play will be associated with basic forms of language, and complex forms of symbolic play will be associated with complex forms of language. We micro-coded 288 symbolic vignettes gathered during a yearlong prospective bi-weekly examination (N = 14; from 6 to 18 months of age). Results showed that the age of initiation of single-object symbolic play correlates strongly with the age of initiation of later-emerging symbolic and vocal outputs; its frequency at initiation is correlated with frequency at initiation of babbling, later-emerging speech, and multi-object play in initiation. Results support the notion that a single-object play relates to the development of other symbolic forms via a direct relationship and an indirect relationship, rather than a dual-path hypothesis.","language, Symbolic development, Play, Babbling, Speech, Mother responsiveness",1,No,8 boys; 6 girls,12,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Play is an important developmental outcome to the extent that child's play and social communication are related to later development of self-regulation and effective functional skills, and play serves as an important avenue of early intervention. The current study investigated associations between maternal flexibility and toddler play sophistication in Caucasian, Spanish speaking Hispanic, English speaking Hispanic, and Native American toddlers (18-22 months adjusted age) in a cross-sectional cohort of 73 toddlers born VLBW and their mothers. We found that the association between maternal flexibility and toddler play sophistication differed by ethnicity (F(3,65) = 3.34, p = .02). In particular, Spanish speaking Hispanic dyads evidenced a significant positive association between maternal flexibility and play sophistication of medium effect size. Results for Native Americans were parallel to those of Spanish speaking Hispanic dyads: the relationship between flexibility and play sophistication was positive and of small-medium effect size. Findings indicate that for Caucasians and English speaking Hispanics, flexibility evidenced a non-significant (negative and small effect size) association with toddler play sophistication. Significant follow-up contrasts revealed that the associations for Caucasian and English speaking Hispanic dyads were significantly different from those of the other two ethnic groups. Results remained unchanged after adjusting for the amount of maternal language, an index of maternal engagement and stimulation; and after adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, gender, test age, cognitive ability, as well maternal age, education, and income. Our results provide preliminary evidence that ethnicity and acculturation may mediate the association between maternal interactive behavior such as flexibility and toddler developmental outcomes, as indexed by play sophistication. Addressing these association differences is particularly important in children born VLBW because interventions targeting parent interaction strategies such as maternal flexibility must account for ethnic-cultural differences in order to promote toddler developmental outcomes through play paradigms.","Very low birth weight, Toddlers, Maternal intrusiveness, Developmental outcome, Ethnicity",1,No,38 boys; 35 girls,20.19,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Qualitative explorations found that parents perceived other adults such as surrounding family and friends to promote gender differences but not themselves; however, parents’ verbal interactions with infants did appear to differ by gender. Parents of males more frequently made statements to promote gross motor skills while parents of females more frequently made statements to promote fine motor skills.

Objective
In this study, we prospectively compared the gross motor development of a cohort at risk for ASDs; infant siblings of children with ASDs (AU sibs) to low risk typically developing (LR) infants.
Methods
24 AU sibs and 24 LR infants were observed at 3 and 6 months using a standardized motor measure, the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). In addition, as part of a larger study, the AU sibs also received a follow-up assessment to determine motor and communication performance at 18 months using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.
Results
Significantly more AU sibs showed motor delays at 3 and 6 months than LR infants. The majority of the AU sibs showed both early motor delays and later communication delays.
Limitations
Small sample size and limited follow-up.
Conclusions
Early motor delays are more common in AU sibs than LR infants. Communication delays later emerged in 67-73% of the AU sibs who had presented with early motor delays. Overall, early motor delays may be predictive of future communication delays in children at risk for autism.","language, Motor, Communication, Autism, Infants, Early identification",2,No,21 boys; 27 girls,6.5,No,No,,Yes,18 boys; 18 girls,3.85,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Results revealed that infants gradually modified their behavior towards more accurate matches over successive trials. It is proposed that early imitation serves a social identity function. Infants are motivated to imitate after a 24-hr delay as a means of clarifying whether the person they see before them is the same one they previously encountered. They use the reenactment of a person’s behavior to probe whether this is the same person. In the domain of inanimate objects, infants use physical manipulations (e.g., shaking) to perform this function.

The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of prone or supine position on sleep states and on withdrawal and approach reactions of preterm infants.
Methods
Thirty-two preterm infants from Meir Medical Center, Israel, mean post menstrual age 30.37 ± 2.57, mean birth weight 1250 g ± 313.86, participated in the study. Infants were studied during 48 h. Positions (prone and supine) were alternated every 3-4 h after feedings. Sleep states were assessed by Actigraph measurement and by two daily 30-min Naturalistic Observations of Newborn Behavior (NONB) to confirm sleep states and for recording the behavioral reactions (approach and withdrawal).
Results
In the prone position there were more approach reactions as compared to withdrawal reactions (p < .001) while in the supine position, the approach and withdrawal reactions were comparable. In the prone position more sleep patterns (deep sleep, light sleep, drowsy) were observed as opposed to more awake patterns (quiet awake, active awake and agitated fussy) that were seen in the supine position.
Conclusions
Clinical implications encourage placing the preterm infant in the prone position while in the NICU. This enables important achievements such as longer periods of quality sleep, and production of adaptive self-regulatory reactions.","Behavior, Preterm infants, Prone position, Sleep, Supine position",1,No,12 boys; 20 girls,7.59,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

However, when interacting with objects, infants performed the same behaviors they performed on their bare hands but they performed them more often and in unique combinations. The results support the tenets that: (1) the development of object exploration begins in the first months of life as infants learn to selectively perform exploratory behaviors on their bodies and objects, (2) the onset of reaching is accompanied by significant increases in exploration of both objects and one's own body, (3) infants adapt their self-exploratory behaviors by amplifying their performance and combining them in unique ways to interact with objects.","cognition/cognitive development, Object exploration, Self-exploration, Reaching, Infant development, Tool use",1,No,21 boys; 21 girls,2.04,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Three-month-old infants of 32 depressed mothers treated with SRI medications during pregnancy and 43 non-medicated mothers were studied. Using an established face-to-face mother-infant interaction paradigm, dyad interactions were studied with and without a toy. Videotaped sessions yielded 4 measures: maternal sensitivity, dyadic organization, infant readiness to interact, and maternal interruptive behaviors. Even with prenatal SRI treatment, depressed mothers interrupted their infants more during toy play. In the absence of prenatal SRI treatment, maternal postnatal depression adversely influenced infant behavior. Higher levels of maternal depression symptoms at 3 months predicted poorer infant readiness to interact during the toy session. Conversely, in the SRI-exposed group, higher prenatal depression scores predicted greater infant readiness to interact at 3 months. Increased infant readiness with SRI exposure suggests a “fetal programming effect” whereby prenatal maternal mood disturbances shaped a future response to a postnatal depressed maternal environment.","Mother-infant interaction, Maternal depression, Serotonin reuptake inhibitor, Prenatal exposure, Infant development",1,No,11 boys; 19 girls,3.28,Yes,Yes,"MANCOVA - Scores for dyadic organization were greater between mothers and their male infants than between mothers and their female infants (F(1,63) = 16.18, p = .01, _2 = .20)",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Anger expression and three clusters of regulatory behaviors were micro-coded: putative regulatory behaviors, attention manipulation, and play behaviors.

The first, cross-sectional study examined the development of responding to joint attention (RJA) skill in terms of increasing executive efficiency of responding between 9 and 18 months of age.

The second study examined the longitudinal relations between 12-month measures of responding to joint attention and 36-month attention regulation in a delay of gratification task.

Although executive function (EF) is widely considered crucial to several aspects of life, the mechanisms underlying EF development remain largely unexplored, especially for infants. From a behavioral or neurodevelopmental perspective, motor and general cognitive abilities are linked with EF. EF development is a multistage process that starts with sensorimotor interactive behaviors, which become basic cognitive abilities and, in turn, mature EF.
Objectives
This study aims to examine how infant motor and general cognitive abilities are linked with their EF at 3 years of age. This work also aims to explore the potential processes of EF development from early movement.
Methods
A longitudinal study was conducted with 96 infants (55 girls and 41 boys). The infants’ motor and general cognitive abilities were assessed at 1 and 2 years of age with Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Second and Third Editions, respectively. Infants’ EFs were assessed at 3 years of age with Working Memory Span task, Day-Night task, Wrapped Gift task, and modified Gift-in-Bag task.
Results
Children with higher scores for cognitive ability at 2 years of age performed better in working memory, and children with higher scores for gross motor ability at 2 years performed better in cognitive inhibitory control (IC). Motor ability at 1_year and fine/gross motor ability at 2 years indirectly affected cognitive IC via general cognitive ability at 2 years and working memory.
Conclusions
EF development is a multistage process that originates from physical movement to simple cognitive function, and then to complex cognitive function. Infants and toddlers can undergo targeted motor training to promote EF development.","cognition/cognitive development, executive function/control, Infants, Motor ability, General cognitive ability",1,No,41 boys; 55 girls,25.86,Yes,Yes,"Furthermore, girls performed better than boys in Emotional IC [t (79) = 2.72, p < 0.01] - IC = emotional inhibitory control",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Significant correlations indicated that both daytime napping and nighttime sleep were related to encoding and generalization across cues after the 2-h delay; significant findings were not found in relation to baseline or delayed recall performance. We suggest that individual differences in infant sleep habits may be one mechanism underlying the observed variability in recall memory and generalization as these abilities are coming online late in the first year of life.","memory, Sleep, Generalization, Infancy",1,No,13 boys; 12 girls,10.53,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Using a deferred imitation task to evaluate social learning and memory recall, an experimenter modeled three novel behaviors (removing, shaking, and replacing a glove) on a puppet. Infants were tested immediately after being shown the behaviors as well as following a 10-min delay. We found that greater suppression of vagal tone was related to better memory recall in full-term infants tested immediately after the demonstration as well as in preterm infants tested later after a 10-min delay. We also found that preterm infants showed greater coordination of physiology (i.e., tighter coupling of vagal tone, heart rate, and cortisol) at rest and during retrieval than full-term infants. These findings provide new evidence of the important links between changes in autonomic activity and memory recall in infancy. They also raise the intriguing possibility that social learning, imitation behavior, and the formation of new memories are modulated by autonomic activity that is coordinated differently in preterm and full-term infants.","memory, Vagal tone, Cortisol, Imitation, Prematurity",2,No,44 boys; 39 girls,0.71,No,No,,Yes,32 boys; 36 girls,6,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

It also investigated whether mothers and fathers differed in the extent to which these three sources of subjectivity predicted their perceptions. During the third trimester of pregnancy, expectant mothers and fathers in 96 families completed assessments of their personality traits and expectations for their children’s temperament, as well as provided characteristic memories of their relationships with their own caregivers as children. Memories were then coded for themes of growth versus safety and compared to parents’ ratings of perceived child temperament 15 months later. Analyses revealed that, for both parents, prebirth expectations predicted perceptions of positive temperament behaviors. Moreover, fathers who described childhoods characterized by exploration and opportunities for growth also perceived their children as displaying more positive temperamental behaviors, whereas those who described greater safety focus in memories and who had higher levels of negative affectivity reported more negative temperamental behaviors. These findings suggest that mothers’ and fathers’ perceptions of their children are differently related to psychological variables, including autobiographical memories. In turn, it is possible that these subjective perceptions may affect the parenting environment.","memory, Parenting, Expectations, Autobiographical memories, Temperament, Personality",1,No,48 boys; 48 girls,12,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

This study investigated these questions. Pregnant women began reciting or speaking a passage out loud (either Rhyme A or Rhyme B) when their fetuses were 28 weeks gestational age (GA) and continued to do so until their fetuses reached 34 weeks of age, at which time the recitations stopped. Fetuses’ learning and memory of their rhyme were assessed at 28, 32, 33, 34, 36 and 38 weeks. The criterion for learning and memory was the occurrence of a stimulus-elicited heart rate deceleration following onset of a recording of the passage spoken by a female stranger. Detection of a sustained heart rate deceleration began to emerge by 34 weeks GA and was statistically evident at 38 weeks GA. Thus, fetuses begin to show evidence of learning by 34 weeks GA and, without any further exposure to it, are capable of remembering until just prior to birth. Further study using dose-response curves is needed in order to more fully understand how ongoing experience, in the context of ongoing development in the last trimester of pregnancy, affects learning and memory.","attention/selective attention, learning, memory, Fetus, Development, Speech",1,No,18 boys; 14 girls,0,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Mothers of 1351 mothers of infants (ages 3-13 months) in Brazil completed an internet-based expanded version of the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire and the Ages & Stages Questionnaire.
Results
Overall, there were associations among parental ratings of infants’ bedtime, morning, and daytime mood with sleep outcomes, especially sleep fragmentation, duration of nighttime sleep, and parental perception of sleep problems. There were no relationships between any sleep variables and developmental outcomes, including communication, fine and gross motor skills, problem-solving, and personal social relationships.

Premature infants lack the tactile stimulation they would have otherwise experienced in the womb. Infant massage is a developmentally supportive intervention that has been documented for several decades to have a positive effect on both full term and preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long term benefits of massage on stable preterm infants.
Methods
A quasi experimental design was used, 66 infants were recruited from two university hospitals with tertiary level NICUs; 32 infants received the massage therapy by their mothers. Data collection by a researcher blind to the infants’ group assignments included weight at discharge, pain responses on the PIPP scale at discharge, length of stay in hospital, neuro-developmental outcome (Bayley scores) and breastfeeding duration at 12 months corrected age.
Results
Infants who were massaged had significantly lower scores on the PIPP after a heel-stick compared to before the massage and had lower PIPP scores at discharge compared to the control group. Massaged infants had higher cognitive scores at 12 months corrected age. Weight gain, length of stay, breastfeeding duration and motor scores did not differ between groups.

Interestingly, very soon after learning to reach, 4-7-month-old infants start coordinating their arms with their trunk and legs for sitting. In this longitudinal study, we focused, for the first time, on how infants learn to use their arms for the dual tasks of reaching for objects while providing arm support as they learn to sit. We hypothesized that the use of arms for support during sitting development would be a temporary perturbation to reaching and result in a nonlinear progression of reaching skill.

Eleven infants were studied monthly from the time they began to prop sit to the time of sitting independence (5-8 months of age). Behavioral coding, kinematics, and electromyography (EMG) characterized reaching and posture while infants sat as independently as possible. Results revealed significant changes across time in trunk movement and hand use as infants transitioned through three stages of sitting: with arm support, sitting briefly without arm support, and sitting independently. Infants used their hands more for contacting objects and less for posture support linearly across time. In contrast, changes in posture control as indicated by pelvis and trunk movement demonstrated a U-shaped curve with more movement of these two body segments during the middle stage of sitting than in the first or last stage. During the middle stage of sitting infants reached persistently even though posture control, measured by pelvis and trunk movement, appeared to be significantly challenged. Muscle activation consisted of tonic and variable combinations of muscle pairings in early sitting. As infants progressed to sitting without hand support, variable but successful strategies utilizing lower extremity muscles in a tight linkage with reach onset emerged to provide prospective control for reaching. Our findings support the contention that reaching both drives the development of sitting in infancy as well as perturbs sitting posture, factoring into the assembly of the complex dual sit-reach behavior that supports and expands flexible interaction with the environment.","Infant development, Sitting, Reaching",3,No,6 boys; 5 girls,4.5,No,No,,Yes,6 boys; 5 girls,5.7,No,No,,Yes,6 boys; 5 girls,7,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

In the discussion, it is suggested that increased speed of infant arm movements during negative affect functions to elicit faster caregiving responses, and that increased head distance during negative infant affect functions to decrease the intensity of the interaction. Finally, the slower speed of arm movements in PPD mothers suggests psychomotor retardation, which is proposed to limit these mothers’ abilities to engage their infants during the interaction.","emotion/emotional development, Mother-infant interaction, Motor activity, Spatial proximity, Motion capture, Emotion expression and regulation, Postpartum depression",1,No,32 boys; 35 girls,4,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Conceptual and item analyses provided support for 14 of the 16 proposed scales, demonstrating satisfactory internal consistency. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated, with evidence of moderate agreement between primary and secondary caregivers. Monomethod discriminant validity was demonstrated through an examination of correlations among the Infant Behavior Questionnaire—Revised (IBQ-R) scale scores. Results of the factor analytic procedure were consistent with three broad dimensions of Surgency/Extraversion, Negative Affectivity, and Orienting/Regulation. Developmental and gender differences were also noted for a number of the IBQ-R scales. Specifically, older infants received higher scores on Approach, Vocal Reactivity, High Intensity Pleasure, Activity, Perceptual Sensitivity, Distress to Limitations, and Fear, whereas younger infants’ scores were higher for Low Intensity Pleasure, Cuddliness/Affiliation, and Duration of Orienting.

Twenty mother-infant dyads from a socio-cultural community with many face-to-face interactions (German families, Münster) were compared with 24 mother-infant dyads from a socio-cultural community with few such interactions (rural Nso families, Cameroon) when the infants were aged 6 and 12 weeks. When infants were 6 weeks old, mothers and their infants from both cultural communities smiled at each other for similar (albeit very short) amounts of time and used imitated each other's smiling similarly rarely.

The findings suggest high variability in the developmental trajectory of footedness, with frequent fluctuation between side preferences. The developmental trajectory of handedness was more stable over the transition between locomotor milestones. The transition between crawling and walking decreased the proportion of infants demonstrating side preferences for leading out and the onset of walking decreased the proportion of infants demonstrating side preferences for reaching.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of family centered physiotherapy according to the neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) principles on mental and motor performance in premature infants.
Methods
A total of 156 infant, ≥24/36 week + 6 days gestational age included in the study. All the infants were diagnosed by a child neurologist and referred to psychology and physiotherapy department for their neurodevelopmental assessment and treatment. Bayley Scale of Infant II (BSI-II) was used for neurodevelopmental assessment and Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) was used for assessing their motor performance. Seventy-eight of the infants were in the study group and 76 were recruited as age matched controls according to the classification of their gestational age. Family centered physiotherapy according to the neurodevelopmental treatment principles was used as an intervention and all the mothers are trained accordingly.
Results
Cognitive Development Scores and Motor Development Scores of Bayley II were recorded for the 3., 6., 9., and 12 months respectively. Between the 3. and 12. month of gestational age, within-groups measurements in both Cognitive Development Scores (p < 0.001) and Motor Development Scores (p<0.001) were significantly increased. However, the improvements in both Cognitive Development Scores (p = 0.059) and Motor Development Scores (p = 0.334) between the groups was not different.
Conclusion
Family centered physiotherapy with NDT principles may not be enough to improve motor and cognitive performance in preterm infants at the first year of age. For supporting the motor and cognitive development of the preterm infants other intervention modalities also should be considered.

Seventy-two full-term, normal-weight, healthy children were followed from 3 days postpartum to 6 years. Neonatal behaviour at 3 and 30 days was assessed using the Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale (NBAS), behaviour at 4 and 12 months was assessed using the Infant Behaviour Record (IBR) from the Bayley Scales for Infant Development (BSID) and temperament at 6 years was assessed using the Dimensions of Temperament Survey-Revised (DOTS-R). Negative and positive affectivity and attention were the factors extracted from the behaviours of the IBR. Our results showed a low/moderate correlation between neonatal behaviour on the one hand and behaviour at 4 and 12 months and temperament at 6 years on the other hand. The motor performance, orientation and ANS stability of the neonate at 3 and 30 days were predictors of positive and negative affectivity at 4 months.

The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the stability of mastery motivation between 2 and 3 years of age for two genders; and (2) the associations between early home environment and toddlers’ mastery motivation in children with typical development.
Methods
Data of 102 children developing typically from a birth cohort study at Northern Taiwan were analyzed in two parts: (1) stability part: mastery motivation of children were measured at 2 and 3 years of age; (2) environment part: child-parent dyads were assessed from birth, 4 months, 6 months, and 2-3 years of age. Outcomes variables were measured at ages 2 and 3 years by the Dimension of Mastery Questionnaire-17th version. Main predictive variables were measured by Home Observation for Measuring Environment Inventory (HOME) to collect data of the qualities of home environment at 6 months and 2 years; by the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire to obtain 4-month activity levels; and by the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers to obtain 2-year developmental quotient (DQ).
Results
There was moderate stability of mastery motivation from 2 to 3 years, and girls’ stability was higher than boys’. 6-Month HOME rather than 2-year HOME measures were positively and significantly correlated with instrumental mastery motivation even when controlling for gender, activity level, and DQ.

To longitudinally assess the neurodevelopmental outcomes of late preterm infants (LPI) through the first year of life and to investigate for perinatal conditions that may affect developmental outcomes.
Methods
The study population comprised of 124 LPI, born in a single Israeli inborn center over an eight months period. Thirty-three term infants (TI) were recruited for comparison. Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) for gross motor evaluation was performed at 6 months of age and the Griffiths Mental Development Scales (GMDS) were performed at 12 months (chronological age). Maternal and neonatal covariates, potentially associated with low developmental scores, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression models.
Results
At chronological age of 6 and 12 months, LPI performed significantly lower than TI on all subscales, but when scores were corrected for post conception age, developmental scores were similar in the two groups. In a multivariate model of logistic regression, male gender, emergent cesarean section and higher maternal education (>14 years) were found to be associated with increased risk for lower developmental scores at 12 month of age in LPI.
Conclusions
LPI do not complete their neurodevelopmental maturation by the first year of life. Males and those born after emergent cesarean section (CS) are at increased risk for lower developmental scores.

Infant neurophysiology was derived from a measure of resting EEG asymmetry collected during a baseline episode. Infant regulatory behaviors (mother orienting and distraction) and reactivity to challenge (negative affect) were assessed during an arm restraint procedure. Maternal sensitivity predicted mother-orienting behavior for all infants, regardless of baseline EEG asymmetry. Maternal sensitivity also predicted more distraction behaviors for infants with left frontal EEG asymmetry at baseline. In contrast, maternal sensitivity predicted more negative affect for infants with right frontal EEG asymmetry at baseline.

To examine the association between sleep and social-emotional development in two-year-old toddlers.
Methods
The study is part of a longitudinal cohort study, the Akershus Birth Cohort Study, which targeted all women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital in Norway. The current study is from the fourth round of the study, including 2014 women two years after delivery. The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional (ASQ:SE) were filled out by the mothers and were used to assess toddler sleep, and social-emotional development, respectively. Other domains of development (communication problems, gross motor problems, and fine motor problems) were assessed with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the ASQ:SE, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine both crude associations between sleep variables and social-emotional problems, and adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
The mean sleep duration of the toddlers was 12 h and 27 min; the majority of the children (54%) had 1-2 awakenings per night, while 10% of the children had a sleep onset latency of more than 30 min. All sleep parameters, including short sleep duration, nocturnal awakenings and sleep onset problems, were significantly associated with social-emotional problems in a dose-response manner. For example, sleeping less than 11 h per night was associated with a five-fold increase in the odds of social-emotional problems, compared to sleeping 13-14 h per night. Adjusting for potential confounders, including maternal age, maternal education, marital status, parity, gestational age, child birth-weight and other developmental problems, did not, or only slightly, attenuate the associations between any of the sleep variables and social-emotional problems.
Conclusions
Short sleep duration, nocturnal awakenings and sleep onset problems were all associated with higher odds of social-emotional problems, even after accounting for developmental problems and demographic factors.

Eight infants, aged 6-12 months, and eight adults, were video recorded as they reached for familiar objects or food items. Hand, arm, and trunk movements were assessed frame-by-frame with the Skilled Reaching Rating Scale, previously developed for the assessment of adult reaching, and supplementary kinematic analysis. Reach-to-eat maturation was characterized by three changes. First, for advance, a simple open hand transport gradually matured to a movement associated with pronation and hand shaping of the digits for precision grasping. Second, for withdrawal to the mouth, a direct withdrawal movement gradually became associated with hand supination that oriented the target object to the mouth. Third, associated with the maturation of rotational movements, inaccurate and fragmented hand transport and withdrawal movements developed into precise targeting of the hand-to-object and object-to-mouth. Across the age range, there was a decrease in bimanual reaching and an increase in right handed reaching.

The majority of research examining the influence of social environment on early child development suggests benefits to two-parent households, but contradictory evidence for the effects of siblings. The aims of the present study were to examine the influence of the child's proximal social environment, and the effects of interactions between socioeconomic status and social environment on developmental outcomes.
Methods
Primary caregivers of a representative sample of 10,748 nine-month-old infants in Ireland completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire and provided information on social environment. Adjustment was made for infant and maternal characteristics, household income, and area where the child was living at the time of the study. Further analyses tested for interactions between social environment and household income.
Results
Binary logistic regressions indicated no effects for number of parents in the household. However, the presence of siblings in the household was a consistent predictor of failing to reach milestones in communication, gross motor, problem-solving, and personal-social development. Furthermore, there was a gradient of increasing likelihood of failing in gross motor, problem-solving, and personal-social development with increasing numbers of siblings. Care by a grandparent decreased the likelihood of failing in communication and personal-social development.
Conclusions
These findings do not support the majority of research that finds positive benefits for two-parent households. Similarly, the findings suggest limited effects for non-parental care. However, the observed negative effects of siblings support both the confluence and resource dilution models of sibling effect. Examination of follow-up data may elucidate current findings.","Infant development, Parents, Siblings, Non-parental care",1,Yes,5526 boys; 5222 girls,9,Yes,Yes,"Boys fared worse than girls in all domains except gross motor, and the gender gap was largest in communication (OR 1.56; 95% CIs 1.33, 1.83).

We found that newborns looked longer at the matching visible call in the in_sound condition than in the silent condition in both experiments.

First, the depth and topography of decelerations and proportion of sustained attention (SA) did not vary across habituation at any age, which suggested (in contrast to the tenets of comparator theory) the persistence of substantial cognitive activity at the end of visual habituation. Second, attention termination (AT) robustly declined across trials, suggesting that, contrary to prior thinking, AT might be a sensitive indicant of visual learning. Third, infants at all ages showed an HR increase (startle) to stimulus onset on the first trial, the magnitude of which was associated with subsequent delayed HR deceleration and less SA; thus, stimulus events affect processing during trials. Finally, mean overall HR reliably increased across trials for all ages. This last finding implies the need to distinguish between “phasic” HR changes (e.g., decelerations during looks) and longer term “tonic” HR changes (mean increases across trials) during habituation, and raises the question of what processes the tonic increases might reflect within the habituation paradigm.","attention/selective attention, cognition/cognitive development, learning, memory, perception, habituation",1,No,"n = 208 for the 4-month-olds, n = 200 for the 6-month-olds, and n = 191 for the 8-month-olds (does not specify genders)","n = 208 for the 4-month-olds, n = 200 for the 6-month-olds, and n = 191 for the 8-month-olds (this was a longitudinal study)",No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,1,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

In typical development, postural adjustments during reaching change in the second half of infancy, including increasing rates of direction-specific adjustments. These changes are absent or different in infants at risk of cerebral palsy (CP). To discover whether these changes are related to acquisition of independent walking, we studied postural adjustments during reaching in infants before and after they learned to walk.
Methods
Ten typically developing (TD) infants and 11 infants at very high risk (VHR) of CP were assessed before and after they learned to walk. Reaching movements were elicited during supported sitting, while surface electromyography was recorded of arm, neck, and trunk muscles. Percentages of direction-specific adjustments (first level of control), and recruitment patterns and anticipatory activation (second level of control) were calculated.
Results
In both groups, postural adjustments during reaching were similar before and after acquisition of independent walking. Direction-specificity increased with age in typically developing infants but not in VHR-infants.
Conclusion
Increasing age rather than the transition to independent walking is associated with increasing direction-specificity of TD-infants during reaching while sitting, while infants at very high risk of CP show no increase in direction-specificity, suggesting that they gradually grow into a postural deficit.","Walking, Cerebral palsy, Infants, Postural control, Development",1,No,10 boys; 11 girls,15.68,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Exposure to HIV during pregnancy is a risks to development. Exposed child should have assessed its development since birth. Alberta Infant Motor Scale is a tool which assess gross motor skills, with easy application and low cost. Up to now, this scale had not proven its validity for the population exposed to HIV. It’s necessary to compare its with a gold standard tool, Bayley scale, which assess gross and fine motor skills, has a high cost and longer application time required. Studies compare results of Alberta with Bayley’s total motor score (gross_+_fine). However, it’s also necessary to compare Alberta’s result with only Bayley’s gross motor result, because it’s what both evaluate in common.
Aims
to verify the concurrent validity of AIMS in infants exposed to HIV; to verify the correlation of AIMS and BSITD III for this population and to compare if these coefficients differ in the central age groups and extremities of the AIMS.
Methods
82 infants exposed to HIV evaluated in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th months, with Alberta Infant Motor Scale and Bayley Scale (motor subscale). For analysis of concurrent validity, results of raw scores of the scales were compared with the correlation analysis. First analysis: Alberta’s score with Bayley’s total (gross_+_fine) motor score. Second analysis: Alberta’s score with Bayley’s gross motor score.
Results
In the first correlation analysis, results were: r_=_0.62 in 1_st month, r_=_0.64 in 2nd month, r_=_0.08 in 3rd month, r_=_0.45 in 4th month; r_=_0.62 in 8th month, r_=_0.60 in the 12th month. In the second correlation analysis, results were: r_=_0.69 in 1_st month; r_=_0.58 in 2nd month; r_=_0.25 in 3rd month; r_=_0.45 in the 4th month; r_=_0.77 in 8th month; r_=_0.73 in 12th month. Analyzes of the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th months couldn’t be performed because at these ages all the children had already reached the maximum score in the AIMS. Results were significant and indicate correlation between scales. Found results agree with other studies that found high correlations between the scales in premature and risk groups. However, these studies compare results of gross motor skills assessments with gross and fine motor skills assessments. Our results show that correlation only between the gross motor skills have higher coefficient values, and we believe this is the best way to compare the scales, with what both assessed in common.
Conclusions
Alberta scale has correlation with Bayley scale in assessing of children exposed to HIV, and can be a substitute to Bayley in assessing of these children. Results are stronger when comparing only what both scales assess in common.","Motor development, Infant, HIV/AIDS, Alberta infant motor scale, Child development",1,No,42 boys; 33 girls,9.6,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Touch screen devices are now ubiquitous, and their usage by young children is increasing. However, the effects of these devices on young children are still unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to address the associations of touch screen device exposure with symptomatic emotional and behavioral problems and language development in children between the ages of 18 and 36 months.
Method
A total of 161 primary caregivers of children between the ages of 18 and 36 months were recruited from the pediatric ward and outpatient clinic at a medical center in southern Taiwan. All caregivers were asked to fill out the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1_-5 (CBCL 1_-5) and a questionnaire on basic personal information and touch screen device usage, and they were also interviewed with the Communication and Language Screening Test for Birth to Three Chinese-Speaking Infant-Toddlers (CLST). Independent t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the differences among the categories in the demographic variables and to characterize the touch screen device usage behaviors. Pearson’s correlation was used to analyze the relationship between language delay and the extent of touch screen device exposure. After primary univariate analysis, we used multiple regression models to examine the relationships among the effects of touch screen device usage behaviors on children's emotional and behavioral problems and language development.
Result
The children’s mean age was 25.63 months (SD_=_5.35). Children who spent more time on touch screen devices were more likely to have emotional problems (__=_.219, p_<_.010, 95 % CI: .279-1.518), anxious/depressive symptoms (__=_.206, p_<_.050, 95 % CI: .170-1.244), somatic complaints (__=_.291, p_<_.001, 95% CI: .455-1.462), social withdrawal symptoms (__=_.194, p_<_.050, 95 % CI: 0.133-1.150), attention problems (__=_.300, p_<_.001, 95 % CI: .432-1.267), and aggressive behaviors (__=_.247, p_<_.010, 95 % CI: .967-3.983). The effects were not noted on language development (__=__.136, p_<_.100, 95 % CI: _2.595-.147).
Conclusion
Young children who spent more time on touch screen devices were more likely to have emotional problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, somatic complaints, social withdrawal symptoms, attention problems, and aggressive behaviors, but not language delay.","emotion/emotional development, language, Touch screen device, Digital media, Language development, Behavioral problems, Emotional problems, Smartphone",1,No,86 boys; 75 girls,25.63,Yes,No,"Sex (Boy): emotional problems - Beta = _.104, p = .178, 95% CI = (_1.294 - .242), anxious/depressive symptoms - Beta = _.113, p = .159, 95% CI = (_1.142 - .189), somatic complaints - Beta = .026, p = .733, 95% CI = (_.516 - .732), somatic withdrawal symptoms - Beta = .030, p = .701, 95% CI = (_.508 - .753), sleeping problems - Beta = _.033, p = .677. 95% CI = (_.946- .616), attention problems - Beta = _.011, p = .886, 95% CI = (_.556 - .480), aggressive behaviors - Beta = _.007, p = .931, 95% CI = (_1.952 - 1.788), language development - Beta = _.184, p = .019, 95% CI = (_3.743 - _.343)",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

The results reveal that vocalic changes influence word recognition, irrespective of the kinds of vocalic changes made. While consonant changes influenced word recognition in a similar manner, this was restricted to place and manner of articulation changes. Infants did not display sensitivity to voicing changes. Infants’ sensitivity to vowel mispronunciations, but not consonant mispronunciations, was influenced by their vocabulary size—infants with larger vocabularies were more sensitive to vowel mispronunciations than infants with smaller vocabularies.

Twenty_four different highly familiar and initially novel items were each repeated exactly once either immediately (Experiment 1), or following one intervening item (Experiment 2).

The only distinguishing cue was the preceding determiners versus subject pronouns, the former being the most common for nouns and the latter the most common for verbs, i.e., Det_+_Noun, Pron_+_Verb. We expected that noun categorization may be easier than verb categorization because the co_occurrence of determiners with nouns is more consistent than that of subject pronouns with verbs in French. The results showed that infants grouped the individual determiners as one common class, and that they appeared to use the determiners to categorize novel words into nouns.

There is evidence of differences between very or extremely PR and FT children in relation to characteristics of temperament and language development. However, not many studies have been carried out with healthy PR children.

The participants were 142 low risk PR children (mean gestational age (GA): 32.60 weeks) and 49 FT children (mean GA 39.84 weeks). The temperament of the children was assessed at 10 months of age through the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R). At 22 months of age the cognitive development of the children was assessed through the Spanish adaptation of the Batelle Developmental Inventory (BDI). In order to assess the children's language development the Galician adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates CDI was applied at 30 months of age. In addition, socio-demographic information about the children and their families was gathered at birth.

The results indicate that there were no significant differences in the language measures of interest (word production, MLU3, and sentence complexity) between groups. The only differences found between the PR and the FT children in the IBQ-R were restricted to the smiling and laughter and the fear subscales. Hierarchical regression analyses performed indicate that GA did not have any predictive effect on language measures taken at 30 months. Cognitive scores were an important predictor of language measures, although certain temperament subscales contributed in a significant way to the variance of language measures, particularly low intensity pleasure, approach, high intensity pleasure, sadness, and vocal reactivity. Therefore, extroverted (positive affectivity) temperament seems to be beneficial for language development.","language, Preterm children, Temperament, Language development, Predictive factors",3,Yes,88 boys; 95 girls,10,No,No,,Yes,83 boys; 89 girls,22,No,No,,Yes,59 boys; 75 girls,30,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Infants scanned and processed differently happy, neutral, and fearful faces. In addition, infants cared for by both father and mother (divided parental leave) distributed their gaze more across faces than did infants primarily cared for by one parent (in this study, the mother). Pupil diameter complemented these findings, revealing that infants had larger pupil diameter during observation of neutral emotions expressed by the parent who is not currently the primary caregiver. This study demonstrates how conclusions differ as a function of the particular eye_tracking measure used and shows that the three measures used here converge on the conclusion that 14_month_old infants’ processing of emotional expressions is influenced by infants’ exposure to fathers and mothers.","categorization, perception, emotional expressions; pupil diameter",1,No,25 boys; 24 girls,14,Yes,No,"No statistics reported, but ""preliminary analyses did not demonstrate any effect of the infants’ gender, nor were there any differences in overall fixation duration between the different stimulus categories; therefore, this variable was not included in the following analysis.""",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

We compared imitative responses of newborn infants presented either visual_only, audiovisual congruent, or audiovisual incongruent models. Our results revealed that the newborns imitated significantly more quickly the movements of the model's mouth when this model was audiovisual congruent rather than visual_only. Moreover, when observing an audiovisual incongruent model, the newborns did not produce imitative behavior. These findings, by highlighting the influence of speech perception on newborns' imitative responses, suggest that the neural architecture for perception-production is already in place at birth.

The mu response during 14_month_old infants' own executed actions showed a differential hemispheric response between acting on heavier and lighter objects. EEG responses also showed sensitivity to “expected object weight” when infants simply observed an experimenter reach for objects that the infants' prior experience indicated were heavier vs. lighter.

Until now, however, it has been unclear whether it was the onset of walking per se that influenced reaching patterns or whether a more general shift to an upright posture might have prompted the reorganization of the motor system. To address this question, the current study longitudinally chronicled the uni_ and bimanual reaching preferences of 25 infants every 3 weeks starting at 7 months, prior to the onset of pulling_to_stand and through the onset of cruising. Experimenters recorded infants' reaching behavior via a semi_structured reaching procedure and documented their motor development. There was no relationship between the shift from uni_ to bimanual reaching and the onset of pulling_to_stand. However, the onset of cruising was related to a shift in reaching pattern preference, suggesting that the increase in infants' bimanual reaching was prompted by a reorganization of the motor system in which the arms are recruited for use in new ways to support locomotion. We also discuss individual differences in the trajectory of reaching activity in terms of the pitfalls of using age as an explanatory variable.",unimanual reaching; bimanual reaching; motor system,1,No,16 boys; 9 girls,longitudinal from 7 to 12.5 months (every 3 week home visits),Yes,No,"No statistic, but ""a 2 (gender) _ 2 (trial type: midline vs. dual presentation) _ 7 (session) repeated_measures ANOVA on reaching pattern preference revealed no main effects for trial type or gender.

We examined cruisers' understanding of support for upright locomotion under four conditions: cruising over a wooden handrail at chest height, a large gap in the handrail, a wobbly unstable handrail, and an ill_positioned low handrail. Infants distinguished among the support properties of the handrails with differential attempts to cruise and handrail_specific forms of haptic exploration and gait modifications. They consistently attempted the wood handrail, rarely attempted the gap, and occasionally attempted the low and wobbly handrails. On the wood and gap handrails, attempt rates matched the probability of cruising successfully, but on the low and wobbly handrails, attempt rates under_ and overestimated the probability of success, respectively. Haptic exploration was most frequent and varied on the wobbly handrail, and gait modifications—including previously undocumented “knee cruising”—were most frequent and effective on the low handrail.

Yet, the real_time effects of postural position on infants' object exploration have been largely ignored. In the current study, 5_ to 7_month_old infants (N = 29) handled objects while placed in supported sitting, supine, and prone postures, and their spontaneous exploratory behaviors were observed. Infants produced more manual, oral, and visual exploration in sitting compared to lying supine and prone. Moreover, while sitting, infants more often coupled manual exploration with mouthing and visual examination. Infants' opportunities for learning from object exploration are embedded within a real_time postural context that constrains the quantity and quality of exploratory behavior.","cognition/cognitive development, learning, postural position; manual exploration",1,No,14 boys; 15 girls,6,Yes,No,"No statistic, but ""preliminary analyses indicated that Infants' sex, trial number, and the presentation order of posture conditions did not affect object exploration.""",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Here, this nonexclusive pattern of object use was explored. Because it has been unclear whether a mature “one tool, one function” bias in assigning object functions is rooted in deployment of general learning principles or artifact_specific thinking, Study 1 explored 24_month_olds' exploitation of social_pragmatic cues when mapping labels, facts, and functions to novel objects. Results demonstrated that toddlers readily used a principle of mutual exclusivity to constrain assignments of labels and facts but not functions. This performance was corroborated in Study 2. It appears that 24_month_olds have a developing understanding that artifacts have specialized functions but that mutual exclusivity does not guide this development.","mutual exclusivity; one tool, one function",2,No,8 boys; 11 girls,24,No,No,,Yes,11 boys; 10 girls,24,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
