Premature infants lack the tactile stimulation they would have otherwise experienced in the womb. Infant massage is a developmentally supportive intervention that has been documented for several decades to have a positive effect on both full term and preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long term benefits of massage on stable preterm infants.
Methods
A quasi experimental design was used, 66 infants were recruited from two university hospitals with tertiary level NICUs; 32 infants received the massage therapy by their mothers. Data collection by a researcher blind to the infants’ group assignments included weight at discharge, pain responses on the PIPP scale at discharge, length of stay in hospital, neuro-developmental outcome (Bayley scores) and breastfeeding duration at 12 months corrected age.
Results
Infants who were massaged had significantly lower scores on the PIPP after a heel-stick compared to before the massage and had lower PIPP scores at discharge compared to the control group. Massaged infants had higher cognitive scores at 12 months corrected age. Weight gain, length of stay, breastfeeding duration and motor scores did not differ between groups.
Conclusion
Stable preterm infants benefit from massage therapy given by their mothers and may be a culturally acceptable form of intervention to improve the outcomes of preterm infants.","cognition/cognitive development, Premature, Tactile massage, Pain, Bayley score, Breastfeeding, Motor development",1,No,27 boys; 23 girls,12,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Sixty-four infants (34 boys) were observed with their primary caregivers in child care centers at 3, 6, and 9 months of age. Caregiver behavior was rated for sensitivity and for stimulation of infant development during one-to-one caregiving interactions. Infant cognitive development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (Mental Development Index). Higher levels of developmental stimulation in the centers predicted higher levels of infant cognitive development at 9 months, beyond infant cognitive development at 3 months (just before entering child care), parental education, and maternal sensitivity.

As a first step to studying motivation to move directly, we qualitatively assessed motivation to move and measured its relationship to motor development in infancy. We observed 27 infants longitudinally from ages 7 to 12 months. Every 3 weeks we assessed infants’ motor motivation based on persistence, activity level, activity preference, and stimulus strength needed to elicit movement. We documented the onset of sitting, pulling-to-stand, crawling and cruising, as well as infants’ overall motor development as measured with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). Motor motivation increased over the course of the study and we identified two distinct motivation profiles. Strongly motivated infants had earlier onsets for all four motor milestones than weakly motivated infants (all p-values <0.05). Infants’ motivation to move score was positively correlated with their AIMS percentile at the same and subsequent sessions. These findings provide empirical evidence for a motivational cascade whereby motivation to move and motor development enjoy a reciprocal relationship. These findings have important clinical implications for children with motor delay, suggesting that evaluation of motivation could be included as part of the assessment procedure so that both treatment and expectations can be tailored appropriately.","Infancy, Motor development, Motivation to move, Individual differences, Motivational cascade",1,No,17 boys; 10 girls,9.5,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Study 1 showed that locomotor skill affects limb lateralization preferences and that most 13-month-old infants demonstrated a side preference for reaching and leading out “in the moment.” Study 2 longitudinally examined the developmental trajectories of handedness and footedness as they related to locomotor posture and experience. The findings suggest high variability in the developmental trajectory of footedness, with frequent fluctuation between side preferences. The developmental trajectory of handedness was more stable over the transition between locomotor milestones. The transition between crawling and walking decreased the proportion of infants demonstrating side preferences for leading out and the onset of walking decreased the proportion of infants demonstrating side preferences for reaching. These findings demonstrate the importance of making behavioral observations at multiple time scales to understand underlying developmental trajectories, specifically the stability or instability of the motor system associated with the acquisition of new motor abilities.","Handedness, Footedness, Lateralization, Developmental trajectory, Infancy",2,No,51 boys; 51 girls,13.02,No,No,,Yes,25 boys; 19 girls,11,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Motor delays have been reported in retrospective studies of young infants who later develop Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs).
Objective
In this study, we prospectively compared the gross motor development of a cohort at risk for ASDs; infant siblings of children with ASDs (AU sibs) to low risk typically developing (LR) infants.
Methods
24 AU sibs and 24 LR infants were observed at 3 and 6 months using a standardized motor measure, the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). In addition, as part of a larger study, the AU sibs also received a follow-up assessment to determine motor and communication performance at 18 months using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.
Results
Significantly more AU sibs showed motor delays at 3 and 6 months than LR infants. The majority of the AU sibs showed both early motor delays and later communication delays.
Limitations
Small sample size and limited follow-up.
Conclusions
Early motor delays are more common in AU sibs than LR infants. Communication delays later emerged in 67–73% of the AU sibs who had presented with early motor delays. Overall, early motor delays may be predictive of future communication delays in children at risk for autism.","language, Motor, Communication, Autism, Infants, Early identification",2,No,21 boys; 27 girls,6.5,No,No,,Yes,18 boys; 18 girls,3.85,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

We aimed to explore these changes between 3 and 6 months because musical routines become prominent in the repertoire of games parents and infants spontaneously play during a period referred to as ‘the period of games’. We focused specifically on expressive timing because it reflects how mothers dynamically adapt their singing to their infant's states of attention and involvement. We aimed to determine whether the expressive timing cues of maternal singing would be different at 3 and then at 6 months. To this end, the interactions of 18 mother–infant dyads were recorded while mothers were singing a popular French playsong for their infant at 3 and then at 6 months. Acoustic analyses revealed that mothers showed final-lengthening and tempo slowing for both age groups, but marked the ends of the hierarchical structural units of the song more saliently with their 6-month-olds.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of family centered physiotherapy according to the neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) principles on mental and motor performance in premature infants.
Methods
A total of 156 infant, ≥24/36 week + 6 days gestational age included in the study. All the infants were diagnosed by a child neurologist and referred to psychology and physiotherapy department for their neurodevelopmental assessment and treatment. Bayley Scale of Infant II (BSI-II) was used for neurodevelopmental assessment and Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) was used for assessing their motor performance. Seventy-eight of the infants were in the study group and 76 were recruited as age matched controls according to the classification of their gestational age. Family centered physiotherapy according to the neurodevelopmental treatment principles was used as an intervention and all the mothers are trained accordingly.
Results
Cognitive Development Scores and Motor Development Scores of Bayley II were recorded for the 3., 6., 9., and 12 months respectively. Between the 3. and 12. month of gestational age, within-groups measurements in both Cognitive Development Scores (p < 0.001) and Motor Development Scores (p<0.001) were significantly increased. However, the improvements in both Cognitive Development Scores (p = 0.059) and Motor Development Scores (p = 0.334) between the groups was not different.
Conclusion
Family centered physiotherapy with NDT principles may not be enough to improve motor and cognitive performance in preterm infants at the first year of age. For supporting the motor and cognitive development of the preterm infants other intervention modalities also should be considered.

Play is an important developmental outcome to the extent that child's play and social communication are related to later development of self-regulation and effective functional skills, and play serves as an important avenue of early intervention. The current study investigated associations between maternal flexibility and toddler play sophistication in Caucasian, Spanish speaking Hispanic, English speaking Hispanic, and Native American toddlers (18–22 months adjusted age) in a cross-sectional cohort of 73 toddlers born VLBW and their mothers. We found that the association between maternal flexibility and toddler play sophistication differed by ethnicity (F(3,65) = 3.34, p = .02). In particular, Spanish speaking Hispanic dyads evidenced a significant positive association between maternal flexibility and play sophistication of medium effect size. Results for Native Americans were parallel to those of Spanish speaking Hispanic dyads: the relationship between flexibility and play sophistication was positive and of small-medium effect size. Findings indicate that for Caucasians and English speaking Hispanics, flexibility evidenced a non-significant (negative and small effect size) association with toddler play sophistication. Significant follow-up contrasts revealed that the associations for Caucasian and English speaking Hispanic dyads were significantly different from those of the other two ethnic groups. Results remained unchanged after adjusting for the amount of maternal language, an index of maternal engagement and stimulation; and after adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, gender, test age, cognitive ability, as well maternal age, education, and income. Our results provide preliminary evidence that ethnicity and acculturation may mediate the association between maternal interactive behavior such as flexibility and toddler developmental outcomes, as indexed by play sophistication. Addressing these association differences is particularly important in children born VLBW because interventions targeting parent interaction strategies such as maternal flexibility must account for ethnic–cultural differences in order to promote toddler developmental outcomes through play paradigms.","Very low birth weight, Toddlers, Maternal intrusiveness, Developmental outcome, Ethnicity",1,No,38 boys; 35 girls,20.19,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Children expressed the most anger during the TR, less during the SF, and minimally during the DG. Use of putative regulatory behaviors was highest during the SF, whereas during the TR children employed newly acquired skills, such as focused attention and substitutive play, in the service of anger regulation. Anger expression and regulation were differentially related to the negative and positive components in the mother's behavior and representations, and maternal intrusiveness moderated the relations between angry representations and the degree of child anger during the SF.

Interestingly, very soon after learning to reach, 4–7-month-old infants start coordinating their arms with their trunk and legs for sitting. In this longitudinal study, we focused, for the first time, on how infants learn to use their arms for the dual tasks of reaching for objects while providing arm support as they learn to sit. We hypothesized that the use of arms for support during sitting development would be a temporary perturbation to reaching and result in a nonlinear progression of reaching skill.

Eleven infants were studied monthly from the time they began to prop sit to the time of sitting independence (5–8 months of age). Behavioral coding, kinematics, and electromyography (EMG) characterized reaching and posture while infants sat as independently as possible. Results revealed significant changes across time in trunk movement and hand use as infants transitioned through three stages of sitting: with arm support, sitting briefly without arm support, and sitting independently. Infants used their hands more for contacting objects and less for posture support linearly across time. In contrast, changes in posture control as indicated by pelvis and trunk movement demonstrated a U-shaped curve with more movement of these two body segments during the middle stage of sitting than in the first or last stage. During the middle stage of sitting infants reached persistently even though posture control, measured by pelvis and trunk movement, appeared to be significantly challenged. Muscle activation consisted of tonic and variable combinations of muscle pairings in early sitting. As infants progressed to sitting without hand support, variable but successful strategies utilizing lower extremity muscles in a tight linkage with reach onset emerged to provide prospective control for reaching. Our findings support the contention that reaching both drives the development of sitting in infancy as well as perturbs sitting posture, factoring into the assembly of the complex dual sit–reach behavior that supports and expands flexible interaction with the environment.","Infant development, Sitting, Reaching",3,No,6 boys; 5 girls,4.5,No,No,,Yes,6 boys; 5 girls,5.7,No,No,,Yes,6 boys; 5 girls,7,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

To examine the association between sleep and social-emotional development in two-year-old toddlers.
Methods
The study is part of a longitudinal cohort study, the Akershus Birth Cohort Study, which targeted all women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital in Norway. The current study is from the fourth round of the study, including 2014 women two years after delivery. The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional (ASQ:SE) were filled out by the mothers and were used to assess toddler sleep, and social-emotional development, respectively. Other domains of development (communication problems, gross motor problems, and fine motor problems) were assessed with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the ASQ:SE, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine both crude associations between sleep variables and social-emotional problems, and adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
The mean sleep duration of the toddlers was 12 h and 27 min; the majority of the children (54%) had 1–2 awakenings per night, while 10% of the children had a sleep onset latency of more than 30 min. All sleep parameters, including short sleep duration, nocturnal awakenings and sleep onset problems, were significantly associated with social-emotional problems in a dose-response manner. For example, sleeping less than 11 h per night was associated with a five-fold increase in the odds of social-emotional problems, compared to sleeping 13–14 h per night. Adjusting for potential confounders, including maternal age, maternal education, marital status, parity, gestational age, child birth-weight and other developmental problems, did not, or only slightly, attenuate the associations between any of the sleep variables and social-emotional problems.
Conclusions
Short sleep duration, nocturnal awakenings and sleep onset problems were all associated with higher odds of social-emotional problems, even after accounting for developmental problems and demographic factors. Thus, a broad assessment of sleep and social-emotional problems when toddlers present with either can be useful.","emotion/emotional development, Sleep problems, Toddlers, Social-emotional development, Short sleep duration, Nocturnal awakenings",1,No,746 boys; 726 girls,24,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of prone or supine position on sleep states and on withdrawal and approach reactions of preterm infants.
Methods
Thirty-two preterm infants from Meir Medical Center, Israel, mean post menstrual age 30.37 ± 2.57, mean birth weight 1250 g ± 313.86, participated in the study. Infants were studied during 48 h. Positions (prone and supine) were alternated every 3–4 h after feedings. Sleep states were assessed by Actigraph measurement and by two daily 30-min Naturalistic Observations of Newborn Behavior (NONB) to confirm sleep states and for recording the behavioral reactions (approach and withdrawal).
Results
In the prone position there were more approach reactions as compared to withdrawal reactions (p < .001) while in the supine position, the approach and withdrawal reactions were comparable. In the prone position more sleep patterns (deep sleep, light sleep, drowsy) were observed as opposed to more awake patterns (quiet awake, active awake and agitated fussy) that were seen in the supine position.
Conclusions
Clinical implications encourage placing the preterm infant in the prone position while in the NICU. This enables important achievements such as longer periods of quality sleep, and production of adaptive self-regulatory reactions.","Behavior, Preterm infants, Prone position, Sleep, Supine position",1,No,12 boys; 20 girls,7.59,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

To determine the effect of developmental care on neurodevelopmental outcome in formerly preterm infants at a corrected age of 2 years.
Methods
A prospective phase-lag study was performed at an Austrian neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

The association between developmental care and delayed motor or mental development (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II; psychomotor or mental developmental index <85) was analyzed by means of logistic regression analysis at a corrected age of 24 months.
Results
Children in the developmental care group showed less psychomotor delay than did those in the control group (developmental care group: 16.1%, conventional care group 27.4%; adjusted odds ratio 0.37 [95% confidence interval: 0.19–0.74], P = 0.005). Not smoking in pregnancy and higher gestational age were also significant predictors for a better psychomotor outcome at 2 years of age.

The study sample consisted of 515 infants (mean age 12.9 [SD 0.9] months) and their parents (514 mothers, 434 fathers), who were recruited in child health centers in Northern Finland. The infants were divided into two groups, based on their BITSEA screen status, and motor milestone achievement ages were compared across BITSEA screen status No Concern and Of-Concern infants. An Of-Concern screen status on the maternal and paternal Competence scale and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) item cluster was associated with later infant achievement ages for gross motor milestones. By contrast, infants who were screened to be in the Of-Concern range on the maternal Problem scale achieved gross motor milestones earlier than infants with the corresponding No Concern screen status. No significant associations were found between the paternal Problem scale screen status and infant motor development. In further analyses, the strongest associations were found between an Of-Concern screen status on the paternal Competence scale and ASD item cluster and infant motor development.

This study investigated these questions. Pregnant women began reciting or speaking a passage out loud (either Rhyme A or Rhyme B) when their fetuses were 28 weeks gestational age (GA) and continued to do so until their fetuses reached 34 weeks of age, at which time the recitations stopped. Fetuses’ learning and memory of their rhyme were assessed at 28, 32, 33, 34, 36 and 38 weeks. The criterion for learning and memory was the occurrence of a stimulus-elicited heart rate deceleration following onset of a recording of the passage spoken by a female stranger. Detection of a sustained heart rate deceleration began to emerge by 34 weeks GA and was statistically evident at 38 weeks GA. Thus, fetuses begin to show evidence of learning by 34 weeks GA and, without any further exposure to it, are capable of remembering until just prior to birth.

Literature addressing the effects of television exposure on developmental skills of young children less than 36 months of age is scarce. This study explored how much time young children spend viewing television and investigated its effects on cognitive, language, and motor developmental skills.
Methods
Data were collected from the Pediatric Clinics at University Medical Center in Southern Taiwan. The participants comprised 75 children who were frequently exposed to television and 75 children who were not or infrequently exposed to television between 15 and 35 months old. The age and sex were matched in the two groups. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development-second edition and Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition were used to identify developmental skills. Independent t-tests, χ2 tests, and logistic regression models were conducted.
Results
Among 75 children who were frequently exposed to television, young children watched a daily average of 67.4 min of television before age 2, which was excessive according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Viewing television increased the risk of delayed cognitive, language, and motor development in children who were frequently exposed to television. Cognitive, language, and motor delays in young children were significantly associated with how much time they spent viewing television. The type of care providers was critical in determining the television-viewing time of children.
Conclusion
We recommend that pediatric practitioners explain the impacts of television exposure to parents and caregivers to ensure cognitive, language, and motor development in young children. Advocacy efforts must address the fact that allowing young children to spend excessive time viewing television can be developmentally detrimental.","cognition/cognitive development, language, motor delay, television exposure",1,No,108 boys; 42 girls,24.8,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Memories were then coded for themes of growth versus safety and compared to parents’ ratings of perceived child temperament 15 months later. Analyses revealed that, for both parents, prebirth expectations predicted perceptions of positive temperament behaviors. Moreover, fathers who described childhoods characterized by exploration and opportunities for growth also perceived their children as displaying more positive temperamental behaviors, whereas those who described greater safety focus in memories and who had higher levels of negative affectivity reported more negative temperamental behaviors.

Results revealed that infants gradually modified their behavior towards more accurate matches over successive trials. It is proposed that early imitation serves a social identity function. Infants are motivated to imitate after a 24-hr delay as a means of clarifying whether the person they see before them is the same one they previously encountered. They use the reenactment of a person’s behavior to probe whether this is the same person. In the domain of inanimate objects, infants use physical manipulations (e.g., shaking) to perform this function.

Infants were exposed to redirective and sensitive behavior systematically using an ABA design to examine real-time changes in infants’ behavior as a function of caregiver responses. During the two baseline “A” periods, caregivers were instructed to play as they would at home. During the social response “B” period, caregivers were instructed to respond sensitively to infants’ behavior on one visit and redirectively on the other visit. Results demonstrated that when caregivers behaved redirectively, infants shifted their attention more frequently and decreased the duration of their visual attention. Caregiver responses also resulted in changes in vocal and gesture production.

The aim of the study was to assess the relationship of sleep with mood and development in infancy.
Methods
Mothers of 1351 mothers of infants (ages 3–13 months) in Brazil completed an internet-based expanded version of the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire and the Ages & Stages Questionnaire.
Results
Overall, there were associations among parental ratings of infants’ bedtime, morning, and daytime mood with sleep outcomes, especially sleep fragmentation, duration of nighttime sleep, and parental perception of sleep problems. There were no relationships between any sleep variables and developmental outcomes, including communication, fine and gross motor skills, problem-solving, and personal social relationships.

To longitudinally assess the neurodevelopmental outcomes of late preterm infants (LPI) through the first year of life and to investigate for perinatal conditions that may affect developmental outcomes.
Methods
The study population comprised of 124 LPI, born in a single Israeli inborn center over an eight months period. Thirty-three term infants (TI) were recruited for comparison. Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) for gross motor evaluation was performed at 6 months of age and the Griffiths Mental Development Scales (GMDS) were performed at 12 months (chronological age). Maternal and neonatal covariates, potentially associated with low developmental scores, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression models.
Results
At chronological age of 6 and 12 months, LPI performed significantly lower than TI on all subscales, but when scores were corrected for post conception age, developmental scores were similar in the two groups. In a multivariate model of logistic regression, male gender, emergent cesarean section and higher maternal education (>14 years) were found to be associated with increased risk for lower developmental scores at 12 month of age in LPI.
Conclusions
LPI do not complete their neurodevelopmental maturation by the first year of life. Males and those born after emergent cesarean section (CS) are at increased risk for lower developmental scores.

With respect to FT dyads, ELGA dyads were characterised by less frequent symmetric and more frequent unilateral co-regulation patterns and by less positive and more neutral affective intensity of both infants and mothers. Cognitive, motor and language scores were lower in ELGA infants than in FT infants. Symmetrical co-regulation was related to motor scores in ELGA infants, and to cognitive scores in FT infants. Our findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating the difficulties of ELGA mother–infant dyads at 12 months in sharing the symmetric co-regulation and positive affective intensity and how symmetric co-regulation is strictly related to motor development in ELGA infants. Based on these findings, intervention programmes to foster joint attention, active involvement and positive affective intensity in ELGA dyads and infants’ development in the first year of life should be designed.","cognition/cognitive development, language, Mother–infant interaction, Dyadic co-regulation, Extremely preterm birth, Early affective cognitive, Linguistic and motor development",1,No,20 boys; 20 girls,12,Yes,No,"The ELGA and FT samples were comparable for gender, χ2 (1, N = 40) = 0.400; p = 0.527",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Main predictive variables were measured by Home Observation for Measuring Environment Inventory (HOME) to collect data of the qualities of home environment at 6 months and 2 years; by the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire to obtain 4-month activity levels; and by the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers to obtain 2-year developmental quotient (DQ).
Results
There was moderate stability of mastery motivation from 2 to 3 years, and girls’ stability was higher than boys’. 6-Month HOME rather than 2-year HOME measures were positively and significantly correlated with instrumental mastery motivation even when controlling for gender, activity level, and DQ.
Conclusion
Mastery motivation had moderate stability during the toddler period. The quality of home environment in infancy appeared to have a significant impact on toddler's mastery motivation. To promote mastery motivation, caregivers should provide better quality of home environment for infants/toddlers during the very early years.","Social environments, Mastery motivation, Forecasting, Child development, Temperament",1,Yes,40 boys; 38 girls,39,Yes,No,There were no significant differences in all the variables between genders (p > .05) except that girls had higher CDIIT DQ and higher instrumental mastery motivation than boys in the environmental part of the study.,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressants are increasingly prescribed to manage antenatal maternal illness. The impact of SRIs on early mother–infant interactions was unknown. Three-month-old infants of 32 depressed mothers treated with SRI medications during pregnancy and 43 non-medicated mothers were studied. Using an established face-to-face mother–infant interaction paradigm, dyad interactions were studied with and without a toy. Videotaped sessions yielded 4 measures: maternal sensitivity, dyadic organization, infant readiness to interact, and maternal interruptive behaviors. Even with prenatal SRI treatment, depressed mothers interrupted their infants more during toy play. In the absence of prenatal SRI treatment, maternal postnatal depression adversely influenced infant behavior. Higher levels of maternal depression symptoms at 3 months predicted poorer infant readiness to interact during the toy session. Conversely, in the SRI-exposed group, higher prenatal depression scores predicted greater infant readiness to interact at 3 months. Increased infant readiness with SRI exposure suggests a “fetal programming effect” whereby prenatal maternal mood disturbances shaped a future response to a postnatal depressed maternal environment.","Mother–infant interaction, Maternal depression, Serotonin reuptake inhibitor, Prenatal exposure, Infant development",1,No,11 boys; 19 girls,3.28,Yes,Yes,"MANCOVA - Scores for dyadic organization were greater between mothers and their male infants than between mothers and their female infants (F(1,63) = 16.18, p = .01, η2 = .20)",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Although executive function (EF) is widely considered crucial to several aspects of life, the mechanisms underlying EF development remain largely unexplored, especially for infants. From a behavioral or neurodevelopmental perspective, motor and general cognitive abilities are linked with EF. EF development is a multistage process that starts with sensorimotor interactive behaviors, which become basic cognitive abilities and, in turn, mature EF.
Objectives
This study aims to examine how infant motor and general cognitive abilities are linked with their EF at 3 years of age. This work also aims to explore the potential processes of EF development from early movement.
Methods
A longitudinal study was conducted with 96 infants (55 girls and 41 boys). The infants’ motor and general cognitive abilities were assessed at 1 and 2 years of age with Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Second and Third Editions, respectively. Infants’ EFs were assessed at 3 years of age with Working Memory Span task, Day–Night task, Wrapped Gift task, and modified Gift-in-Bag task.
Results
Children with higher scores for cognitive ability at 2 years of age performed better in working memory, and children with higher scores for gross motor ability at 2 years performed better in cognitive inhibitory control (IC). Motor ability at 1 year and fine/gross motor ability at 2 years indirectly affected cognitive IC via general cognitive ability at 2 years and working memory.
Conclusions
EF development is a multistage process that originates from physical movement to simple cognitive function, and then to complex cognitive function. Infants and toddlers can undergo targeted motor training to promote EF development.","cognition/cognitive development, executive function/control, Infants, Motor ability, General cognitive ability",1,No,41 boys; 55 girls,25.86,Yes,Yes,"Furthermore, girls performed better than boys in Emotional IC [t (79) = 2.72, p < 0.01] - IC = emotional inhibitory control",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
