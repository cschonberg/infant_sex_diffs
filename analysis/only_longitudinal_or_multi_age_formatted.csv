We analyzed heart rate (HR) taken simultaneous with looking during infantâ€controlled habituation sessions collected longitudinally at 4, 6, and 8â€ƒmonths of age with the goal of examining how HR and HRâ€defined phases of attention change across habituation. There were four major findings. First, the depth and topography of decelerations and proportion of sustained attention (SA) did not vary across habituation at any age, which suggested (in contrast to the tenets of comparator theory) the persistence of substantial cognitive activity at the end of visual habituation. Second, attention termination (AT) robustly declined across trials, suggesting that, contrary to prior thinking, AT might be a sensitive indicant of visual learning. Third, infants at all ages showed an HR increase (startle) to stimulus onset on the first trial, the magnitude of which was associated with subsequent delayed HR deceleration and less SA; thus, stimulus events affect processing during trials. Finally, mean overall HR reliably increased across trials for all ages. This last finding implies the need to distinguish between â€œphasicâ€ HR changes (e.g., decelerations during looks) and longer term â€œtonicâ€ HR changes (mean increases across trials) during habituation, and raises the question of what processes the tonic increases might reflect within the habituation paradigm.","attention/selective attention, cognition/cognitive development, learning, memory, perception, habituation",1,No,4,208,6,200,8,191,,,"n = 208 for the 4-month-olds, n = 200 for the 6-month-olds, and n = 191 for the 8-month-olds (does not specify genders)","n = 208 for the 4-month-olds, n = 200 for the 6-month-olds, and n = 191 for the 8-month-olds (this was a longitudinal study)",No,No,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,1

Normative trends as well as variability between and within dyads were tested using a multilevel modeling technique. We found that unilateral coregulation, in which only the mother was actively involved in play, largely prevailed at the beginning of the year and then decreased linearly, while symmetrical patterns, implying that the infant was also involved, were for the most part absent at the beginning but then increased rapidly, overtaking unilateral from the middle of the year on and becoming predominant by the end. In particular, symmetrical episodes of shared affect and shared action increased first and then decreased, being replaced by shared language. Variability in data was significant between the dyads, with some dyads advancing toward symmetrical coregulation at an earlier age and more rapidly than the others. It was also significant within the dyads, as the increase in symmetrical coregulation unfolded in a quite irregular manner across the sessions, unlike the decrease in unilateral.
